        "This is not a new story. I'm sure many of you have heard of Cumaratunga Munidasa's Hathpana, the story of Kirihamy and his seven lives! This Christmas I happened to read the English translation of this beautiful story. The translation is named The Seven Lives. It's a Gunasena publication, translated by Prof Kusuma Karunaratne and Edmund Jayasuriya and the lovely illustrations are by Sybil Wettasinghe. I have read the Sinhala version a long time ago as a child. If you can read both the Sinhala and the English books, you can decide for yourself which one you like better and why.",

          "There are plenty of stories about love affairs between poor and rich families, but very few stories about friendship. If you know the meaning and value of different friendships, there is no better story than Mango Friends. Although this book was made using less of the books that our adults used to give us when we were little, we can say for sure that we have a lot to learn from Nimal's and Sunil's friendship. You may recall that later this book was used to popularize a teledrama.",

          "Upali's stubbornness combined with courage, Jinnah's humility, and Mr. Hinney's laziness joining them later, these became part of our lives with the Madol Duwa story book. Madol Duwa, one of the unique books written by Martin Wickramasinghe, is a book that we still enjoy reading. Not only that, among Martin Wickramasinghe's books, Madol Duwa is often the first book we read. We were able to learn many lessons from this story, such as the value of friendship, unity, and celebration, because our adults did not forget to hand us this book at an early age.",

          "That is how Mahagama Sekara takes us to Radawana Junction, which we have never seen or heard of. From the day they were born, most of the people who walked on the brimstone land saw the beauty of a village and heard that conversation from this book. This book, written in such a brilliant manner, is indeed a cross section of one half of Sekara's life. We saw the sensitive mind of Mahagama Sekara very well from the character of Big Uncle here, which is very accurate. Our elders unmistakably put this book in our hands, so that someone would not have to tell us about the sensitivity that we need to have.",

The story unfolds through the protagonist, Issa, and his family. We have a lot to learn from the role of an older brother in a family and the role of Isa, who devotes his entire life to those responsibilities. Family loyalty, responsibility, and celebration are some of them. Needless to say, this book is as enjoyable today as it was then. ",

Baby love stories, or flower books in our own words, are for that in bookstores today. Although it is a story full of differences, we fell in love with the love story of Devendra Dora and Noriko Sanga without even knowing what love means. In fact, this story written by Ediriweera Sarachchandra is the first love story that most of us read. As we begin to read the book, we learn that the story revolves around a Sri Lankan artist who goes to Japan and a Japanese girl named Noriko whom he meets there But that doesn't stop it from being interesting. In short, it made the story even more interesting.",
